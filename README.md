# TEXT-TO-2D-IMAGE-GENERATOR-AND-3D-MODELING
This project utilizes AI-driven image generation to transform textual descriptions into 2D images and further convert them into 3D models using deep learning techniques. The system leverages Stable Diffusion and PyTorch for generating high-quality 2D images from text and employs Pix2Vox to reconstruct realistic 3D models. The project integrates a Tkinter-based UI, allowing users to input text descriptions and visualize generated images and models in real time.
